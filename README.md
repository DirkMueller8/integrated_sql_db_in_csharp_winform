The objective of this software is to fulfill the requirements of project 22 of the Klett Fernakademie (https://www.fernakademie-klett.de/technik-it/informatik-programmierung-internet/c-software-entwickler/4). It manages a simple library by using the in-built SQL table in Visual Studio 2019, together with a read and write application in WinForms.

The code was mostly written by the instructors, the task of the student is to ensure the correctness of the input. (There ist still a problem with the saving of the form contents.)
